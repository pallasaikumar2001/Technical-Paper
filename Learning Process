# Learning Process.

## What is the Feynman Technique?

The Feynman Technique is a learning method that involves teaching a concept in simple terms to identify gaps in understanding.

## In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

I found three interesting stories in Barbara Oakley's TED Talk.

1. She shares how she struggled with math and science throughout her school years, even failing multiple classes".
2. She attributes this transformation to learning effectively, using techniques like switching between focused and diffused modes of thinking.
3. She explains the importance of sleep in the learning process. During sleep, the brain consolidates new information and forms new neural connections, crucial for effective learning and memory retention.

## What are Active and Diffused modes of thinking?

### Active Mode of thinking:

*. This mode involves intense concentration and focus on a specific task or problem.
*. This mode is more structured and logical, following the tough path to solve problems.
*. Engages specific areas of the brain related to the task at hand.

### Diffused Mode of thinking:

*. This mode is more relaxed and involves a broader, big-picture view.
*. It's used for creativity, problem-solving, and gaining new insights.
*. Allowing for the formation of new connections and ideas.

## According to the video (Learning anything in 2o hours), what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic?

Here are the steps to take when approaching a new topic, as mentioned in the "Learn Anything in 20 Hours" video:

1. Break down the skill into smaller parts.
2. Eliminate obstacles that prevent practice.
3. Commit to practicing for at least 20 hours.
