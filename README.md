# Messaging Queues

Message queues enable communication between various system components, which makes them crucial to system architecture. Because they serve as buffers, messages can be sent and received asynchronously, enabling systems to function normally even if certain components are temporarily or slowly unavailable.
## Usage of Messaging Queues:

**Background Task Processing:** The tasks that don't need to be processed immediately like Sending emails, Video Processing Service can be handled using a Queue.

**Load Balancing for Web Applications:** Messaging queues help distribute incoming requests among available servers, improving the performance of web applications.

**Server Health Monitoring:** A system monitoring tool can push alerts to a queue when a serverâ€™s health metrics go beyond a threshold, triggering alerts or automated actions.

These are some important Messaging Queues.
